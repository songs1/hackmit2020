Voter purging, or the erroneous removal of eligible voters from registration rosters, has revealed itself to be a concerning issue in the state of Georgia in the last five years. Investigations* into publicized voter purging lists have concluded that an alarming number of registered voters were removed on incorrect accounts of moving to a different state or county. Combined with Georgia's voting laws which mandate that all citizens register within 2 weeks of voting and unreliable systems of alerting removed voters, this problem demands a better soltion. Our project, VoterAlertGA, is a notification system that emails members upon detection of changes to their voting registrtion status.
